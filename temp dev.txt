- User ID = email address on sign up
- Tidy up of details which show on the cards for requests/response/files
- does the file upload on a request redirect to the next stage?
- No match selection creates a key error in pandas (map2)
- Delete and start again needs to change to edit item by item
- map at upload a file stage needs to bring through request details and instructions
- map/map2 need a progress line at top
- Better handling of orthan files (auto delete)
- need a logo for the browser tab heading
- email list verification and split on semi colon if no commas
